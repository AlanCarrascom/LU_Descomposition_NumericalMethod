First, the 2 files developed where done in matlab due to the ease it provides to operate matrices, which is key to the LU decomposition methods. 
- doolittle.m: Doolittle LU decomposition method (the L matrix has the unitary main diagonal).
- crout.m: Crout LU decomposition method (the U matrix has the unitary main diagonal).
